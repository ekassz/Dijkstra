# Dijkstra
Dijkstra Graph Implementation Project

I worked on the Implementation method for a Dijkstra Graph named computeShortestPath. This helper method creates a network of SearchNodes while computing the shortest path between the provided start and end locations.
The SearchNode that is returned by this method is represents the end of the shortest path that is found: it's cost is the cost of that shortest path, and the nodes linked together through predecessor references represent all of the nodes along that shortest path (ordered from end to start). I also constructed an completed 3 JUnit Edge Cases that'll test the implementation of a Dijkstra Graph.
